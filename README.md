# Design-a-model-to-predict-the-number-of-international-students-studying-in-the-UK

As we all know, British education has a long history, and Britain is the birthplace of modern universities. Currently, the
five oldest schools in the world all originate from the UK; enjoy a high reputation. Therefore, the UK has also become a dream
destination for many international students. In this project, based on the datasets from HESA (Higher Education Statistics
Agency), I will build two models, polynomial regression and multiple linear regression models and train the dataset from HESA
to predict the future ten years of the total number of international students.
